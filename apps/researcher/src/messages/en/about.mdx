# About the Research Application

The Research Application is originally built for the project 'Against Opacity'
and adjusted for the HackaLOD Hackathon, focusing on archaeological finds and
archives from Arnhem. This hub serves as a central access point for researchers,
developers, and heritage professionals to explore and connect archaeological
datasets from various Dutch institutions. Through the Research Application,
users can access these datasets to answer questions such as: What has been found
in Arnhem? and What do these finds tell us about the city’s past?

The application not only makes archaeological data more accessible but also
supports collaboration between stakeholders, researchers, and the public. It
enables users to add interpretations, contextual information, and links to
related data, fostering a shared understanding of Arnhem’s archaeological
heritage.

## Project

The HackaLOD Hackathon brings together developers, data experts, and cultural
heritage professionals to create innovative tools and applications that enhance
access to linked open data in the cultural heritage domain. For the 2025
edition, we chose to focuse on archaeological finds in Arnhem, with the goal of
making archaeological datasets more transparent, interconnected, and usable for
both professionals and the public.

The project is structured around three work areas:
	1.	Building collaboration – fostering partnerships between museums, archives, municipalities, and developers.
	2.	From data fragmentation to data integration – improving data interoperability and linking across institutions.
	3.	Creating knowledge together – encouraging reuse of heritage data to tell new stories about Arnhem’s archaeological landscape.

Within the data integration work area, the main task is the development of an
online research guide and the data hub. This is particularly valuable for
collections distributed across multiple repositories. The hub enables matching
of datasets across institutions based on categories such as objects, excavation
sites, and chronology.
